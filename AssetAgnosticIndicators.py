    Use interpretable machine learning algorithms again but now
    use indicators that are not dependant on the underlying asset.
    For example, use RSI, MACD crossover signals (e.g. is the signal
    line above or below the blew blew), etc. Predict % return 1mo
    from now for daily data, 6mo from now using weekly data.

    Creates much more training data.

    Example Indicators
        - RSI
        - MACD
        - Standard Deviation
